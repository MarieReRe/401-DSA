## Day 1 Challenge: Reverse an Array
### White Boarding Partner Matt 
For this challenge we are tasked with taking an array and reversing that input without altering the original array or using the built in method of Array.Reverse(). 
#### Challenge Start: 1:15pm
#### Challenge End: 2:45pm
#### Total Time: 2.5 hours
### Description
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

### Possible Stretch Goal
Once you’ve achieved a working solution, implement the same feature with a different methodology. (Hint: what different techniques do you have when working with arrays? Recursion, loops, indexes, modifying the array input directly…)

### Approach and Efficiency
Matt and I approached reversinge this array as taking a test array and inputing the last number (or input) of that array into the first available index of a new "reverse" array.
This approach would be of linear time complexity which is O(n). This is because the time this function takes to run would increase proportionally to the amount of data the function contains.
