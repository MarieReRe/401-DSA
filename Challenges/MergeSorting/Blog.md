# Merge Sorting
Merge sorting is a divide and conquer algorith that divides a group of data into a simpler versions of itself. It divides the algorithm into smaller parts so that they become easier to solve. Usually this solution to the smaller sub-problem can be applied to the bigger problem. Using the same solution for the bigger picture is what makes this algorith recursive.
