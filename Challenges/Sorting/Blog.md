# Insertion Sort in C#
Implementation: 


# Efficency
- Time: O(n^2)
	- Since we will be using nested loops the performance of this algorithm is directly proportiomal to the square of the size of the input data set
- Space: O(1)
	- Insertion sort is being sorted in place, so this will always be the size of the array.





## Test Cases
Sort a unique array
sort same values
sort a reversed array
sort an array that is nearly sorted
